                                            In 1970, Mr. Angelo King (AK), known as the patriarch of the King's group, noticed how
                                            well the motels are doing. Making mathematical computations in his head, AK's
                                            imagination caught re in the prospect of venturing into the motel business. He was bent
                                            on entering the business and decided to work on something most motels failed to give
                                            their clients <span class="white">QUALITY SERVICE.</span>                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            It was in August when AK opened his first motel venture in Pasay City. He named it Anito
                                            Lodge, after a Tagalog god or deity. The first venture led to another. AK opened his
                                            second motel in 1973 and named it Vinta Lodge. It is located in Pasig where a potential
                                            market of moteliers is evident. Soon, more motels came under the belt of the King family.                                        </p>

                                            The year 1980 not only meant the beginning of a new decade for the Company but it also
                                            marked the entry of AK's sons Archie and Wyden, who are said to be the prime movers of
                                            the Company's second generation of drive-in hotel expansion and growth in 1984. The
                                            advent started o with the opening of Akasya Lodge in Sta. Mesa, Manila; the Company
                                            started to evolve and setup district offices. Divided into North and South districts, they
                                            focused their attention to the problems and pressing concerns of each motel in a
                                            professionally managed manner.                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            From that time on, the company's thrust is to provide quality lodging hotels and services
                                            at premium prices. Amenities such as colored TV, bathtubs, Jacuzzis and air conditioners
                                            were likewise provided. Thus, the term "drive-in hotel" was coined for the succeeding
                                            Company establishments.
                                                                             </p>

                                        <p>The almost simultaneous opening of Anahaw and Anito Royale in 1985 brought with it the introduction of mega rooms which where known as
                                            "VIP" rooms. They became popular and increased in number
                                            when talks of AK's imminent semi-retirement became
                                            prevalent.                                        </p>

                                            It was then that Mr. Archie King (ARK) named his first hotel
                                            Panorama Enterprises, Inc. a 38-room property in Pasig,
                                            which he branded as <span class="white">"Victoria Court"</span>. This property was the
                                            most innovative and the classiest motel of its time because
                                            of its first class amenities - bigger rooms and thematic
                                            atmosphere.                                        </p>

                                            Just after this, Fiesta lodge was purchased; it is now called
                                            Victoria Court Cuneta. Although it was operational upon
                                            purchase, renovation was done slowly but surely,
                                            restructuring and reshaping the establishments into an
                                            all-suite drive-in hotel better than Victoria Court Pasig, with
                                            its unique motifs, suite rooms, and mezzanine jacuzzis.                                        </p>

                                            After a few years of operations, Victoria Court Pasig
                                            performed beyond expectation. This gave birth to the
                                            Victoria Court group, and soon, a logo was drummed up,
                                            depicting a classy but mysterious-looking lady in a hush-up
